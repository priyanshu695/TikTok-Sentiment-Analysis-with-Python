# TikTok-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Python

Introduction

One of the social media applications that made it to the top eight in 2023 is TikTok. This application has revolutionized the way we watch short videos. Those who enjoy entertaining and funny short videos are likely already familiar with this app. However, not everyone is interested in it. Some praise it, while others criticize it. The main objective of doing sentiment analysis on the TikTok app is:

    To assess user sentiment about the application, which includes user reviews and comments.
    To gain insight into how users feel about the app, whether they have positive or negative experiences, and their likes or dislikes.
    For the developers to utilize it to improve the applicationâ€™s functionality, solve problems, and respond to user concerns.
    For business people to adjust their marketing strategy on TikTok.

Starting from that perspective, we can use Python to do TikTok review sentiment analysis to see how people react to this application. The availability of various Python modules for analysis gives us a significant edge and significantly speeds up the research process.
